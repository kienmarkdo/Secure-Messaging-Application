This application also considers the following security vulnerabilities and attempts to prevent them:

- Potential network attacks can include Spoofing, sniffing wireless transmissions, a Man in the Middle (MitM) attack with wireless transmission to intercept and/or modify data, Sending improper commands to the controller and backend servers, etc.
- Potential loss of communication, server/network element unreachability and packet loss
- Multi-host network with a minimum of 4 network elements (nodes)

This application implements a custom encryption algorithm for encrypting and decrypting data packets.
